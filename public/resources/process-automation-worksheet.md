## How to Use

### **Step 1: Process Discovery & Documentation**
**üìù Complete the Process Inventory**
Use our structured template to catalog every process in your area:
- Process name and description
- Current manual time investment (hours/week)
- Department/team ownership
- Input and output data requirements
- Systems and tools currently involved

### **Step 2: Automation Assessment**
**üîç Evaluate Each Process**
Score every process using our 5-point framework:
- **Automation Potential** (1-5): How suitable for automation
- **Business Impact** (1-5): Strategic importance to organization
- **Implementation Complexity** (1-5): Technical difficulty level
- **Change Management Risk** (1-5): Team adaptation challenges

### **Step 3: Financial Analysis**
**üíµ Calculate ROI for Priority Processes**
Our built-in calculators help you:
- Estimate current process costs (labor, time, errors)
- Project implementation expenses (technology, training, consulting)
- Calculate expected savings and efficiency gains
- Determine payback period and long-term ROI

### **Step 4: Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
**‚ö° Plan for Success**
Use our risk framework to:
- Identify potential technical and business risks
- Develop mitigation strategies for each risk category
- Plan contingency approaches for critical processes
- Assign risk owners and monitoring responsibilities

### **Step 5: Implementation Planning**
**üöÄ Create Your Automation Roadmap**
Organize your automation journey:
- Sequence projects based on priority scores and dependencies

## üìà **Automation Priority Formula**

Our proven scoring system helps you make data-driven decisions:

**Priority Score = (Automation Potential √ó 0.4) + (Business Impact √ó 0.3) + (ROI √ó 0.2) + (Implementation Readiness √ó 0.1)**

### **Interpretation Guide:**
- **4.0-5.0**: High Priority - Immediate automation candidates
- **3.0-3.9**: Medium Priority - Plan for next quarter implementation
- **2.0-2.9**: Low Priority - Consider for future automation waves
- **<2.0**: Not Recommended - Focus on manual optimization first

  'faq.services.bigdata.question': 'What is big data analytics in simple terms?',
  'faq.services.bigdata.answer': 'Big data analytics is the process of examining large amounts of information to discover patterns and insights that help you make better business decisions.

  'faq.services.ai.question': 'How can AI and automation actually help my business?',
  'faq.services.ai.answer': 'AI and automation can handle repetitive tasks, analyze data faster than humans, and help you make more informed decisions.

You don\'t need to understand the technology; you just need to understand the results.',
  
  'faq.basics.started.question': 'How do we get started working together?',
  'faq.basics.started.answer': 'We begin with a free consultation to understand your business challenges and goals. Then we conduct a comprehensive assessment of your current systems and data landscape. Based on this, we design a strategic solution architecture and present you with a clear roadmap, timeline, and expected outcomes before any implementation begins.',
  
  'faq.basics.timeline.question': 'How long does a typical project take?',
  'faq.basics.timeline.answer': 'Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. Simple CRM implementations can be completed in 30-90 days, while comprehensive data analytics platforms may take 3-6 months. We provide detailed timelines during the planning phase and keep you updated throughout the process with regular milestones and progress reports.',
  
  // Impact FAQs
  'faq.impact.results.question': 'What kind of real-world results can I expect?',
  'faq.impact.results.answer': 'Our clients typically see measurable improvements within 90 days: 25-60% reduction in manual data work, 15-40% improvement in decision-making speed, better customer satisfaction scores, and clearer visibility into business performance. For example, we\'ve helped reduce administrative overhead by 40% in healthcare and improved forecast accuracy by 25% in technology companies.',
  
  'faq.impact.roi.question': 'How do you measure return on investment (ROI)?',
  'faq.impact.roi.answer': 'We establish clear success metrics before starting any project—such as time saved, revenue increased, costs reduced, or efficiency gained. We track these throughout implementation and provide regular reports showing your ROI. Most clients see positive returns within 6-12 months, with benefits continuing to compound over time as your team becomes more data-driven.',
